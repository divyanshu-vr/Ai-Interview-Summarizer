# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Real-Time Interview Summarizer is a desktop application that captures audio from online meetings, converts speech to text in real-time, generates AI-powered summaries, and exports structured documents. The application targets professionals who need automated meeting documentation with support for multiple meeting platforms (Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams) while maintaining privacy through local processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want to capture system audio from online meetings in real-time, so that I can automatically record conversations without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts audio capture THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor and capture system audio
2. WHEN audio is being captured THEN the system SHALL display real-time recording indicators
3. WHEN the user pauses recording THEN the system SHALL temporarily stop audio capture while maintaining session state
4. WHEN the user stops recording THEN the system SHALL finalize the audio capture and prepare for processing
5. IF the system detects no audio input for 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL display a warning notification
6. WHEN capturing audio from different meeting platforms THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent audio quality across Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want real-time speech-to-text conversion, so that I can see live transcription of the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is captured THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text in real-time with less than 2-second latency
2. WHEN transcription confidence is low THEN the system SHALL display confidence indicators to the user
3. IF speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and notify the user
4. WHEN processing audio segments THEN the system SHALL include timestamps for each transcript segment
5. WHEN generating transcripts THEN the system SHALL maintain continuous text flow without speaker segmentation
6. WHEN displaying transcription THEN the system SHALL show real-time text updates in the user interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want AI-powered summarization of the conversation, so that I can quickly understand key points, decisions, and action items without reviewing the entire transcript.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcript segments are available THEN the system SHALL generate intelligent summaries using Google Gemini AI
2. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL identify key discussion points, decisions made, and action items
3. WHEN processing conversations THEN the system SHALL automatically segment discussions into topic-based sections
4. WHEN creating summaries THEN the system SHALL extract important quotes and insights from the conversation
5. IF API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them when limits reset
6. WHEN summaries are generated THEN the system SHALL display them in real-time with 150-200 word concise format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want to see live summary updates in the application interface, so that I can follow along with the key points as the meeting progresses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN summaries are generated THEN the system SHALL display them in real-time in the dashboard
2. WHEN new content is processed THEN the system SHALL update the live summary without disrupting the user experience
3. WHEN displaying summaries THEN the system SHALL show topic segmentation and key points extraction
4. WHEN processing is occurring THEN the system SHALL display processing indicators and confidence levels
5. IF processing is delayed THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and estimated completion times
6. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive controls for start/stop/pause functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want to export summaries as structured documents in multiple formats, so that I can share and archive meeting outcomes according to my workflow needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests document export THEN the system SHALL generate structured documents in PDF, DOCX, and TXT formats
2. WHEN exporting documents THEN the system SHALL include meeting metadata (date, duration)
3. WHEN creating exports THEN the system SHALL organize content with sections for key points, decisions, action items, and quotes
4. WHEN generating documents THEN the system SHALL complete export within 5 seconds
5. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
6. WHEN documents are created THEN the system SHALL allow users to customize summary templates and formats

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a meeting participant, I want the application to work across different meeting platforms, so that I can use the same tool regardless of which platform my meetings are on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using different meeting platforms THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent functionality across Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams
2. WHEN switching between platforms THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt to different audio configurations
3. WHEN platform-specific issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide platform-specific troubleshooting guidance
4. IF a platform is not supported THEN the system SHALL clearly communicate limitations and alternatives
5. WHEN testing compatibility THEN the system SHALL work on Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, and Ubuntu 18.04+
6. WHEN running on different operating systems THEN the system SHALL provide consistent user experience and functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all audio processing to happen locally when possible, so that sensitive meeting content remains secure and private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL perform speech-to-text conversion locally using Web Speech API as primary method
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use local storage (IndexedDB/localStorage) for session data
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL automatically delete temporary audio files after processing
4. WHEN using cloud APIs THEN the system SHALL only send processed text (not audio) to external services
5. IF users export documents THEN the system SHALL provide secure document generation without cloud storage
6. WHEN recording meetings THEN the system SHALL display clear notifications about recording status to ensure participant consent

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through generated summaries and transcripts, so that I can quickly find specific information from past meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users enter search queries THEN the system SHALL search through all stored summaries and transcripts
2. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text and provide context
3. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date or topic
4. WHEN results are found THEN the system SHALL display them with timestamps and meeting metadata
5. IF no results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search terms or broader criteria
6. WHEN managing stored data THEN the system SHALL provide user-controlled data retention policies
